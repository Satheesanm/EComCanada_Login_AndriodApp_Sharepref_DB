# EComCanada_Login_AndriodApp_Sharepref_DB

Login Screen:

The login screen would prompt the user to enter their email and password.
The email and password would be validated, and if they match what is stored in the SharedPreferences database, the user would be logged in and redirected to the app's main screen.
If the user is not already registered, they would be prompted to sign up for an account.
Sign Up Screen:

The sign up screen would prompt the user to enter their email, password, and any other relevant information such as their name and Eaddress.
The entered information would be validated to ensure that it meets any necessary requirements (e.g. password length, email format).
Once the information is validated, the user's account would be created in the SharedPreferences database, and they would be redirected to the app's main screen.
User Info Screen:

The user info screen would display the user's information, such as their name, email, and address.
The user would have the option to edit their information and save any changes, which would update the SharedPreferences database.
The user could also log out of the app, which would clear their login status from SharedPreferences and redirect them to the login screen.
